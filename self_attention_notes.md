## The Problem: Why Self-Attention? {#the-problem}

### The Core Issue: Static Word Embeddings
Traditional RNN-based models use **static word embeddings** - fixed numerical vectors that represent words. This creates a fundamental problem:

**The same word can mean different things in different contexts.**

### Examples of Contextual Meaning

**Word: "Light"**
- "Light" (electromagnetic radiation) - relates to: photons, bright, wave
- "Light weight" - relates to: feathery, delicate, airy
- "Light blue" - relates to: colors, between blue and white
- "Light headed" - relates to: faint, dizzy

**Word: "Apple"**
- "Apple phones" → Apple = technology company
- "Apple juice" → Apple = fruit

### The Problem with Static Embeddings
```
Apple word embedding might have:
- 50% technology properties
- 50% fruit properties

This same embedding is used in BOTH sentences:
- "I love Apple phones" 
- "I love Apple juice"

Result: Ineffective representation in both contexts!
```

**What we need:** Dynamic word representations that change based on sentence context.

---

## Understanding Contextual Word Representation {#contextual-representation}

### The Key Insight
The context of a word is determined by **the other words in the sentence**.

- "Apple" + "phones" → technology context
- "Apple" + "juice" → fruit context

### The Solution Concept
Instead of using static embeddings, create new word representations that are **aware of all other words** in the sentence.

**New Apple representation could be:**
```
Apple' = 0.1 × Love + 0.5 × Apple + 0.4 × Phones
```

This way:
- Apple gets 40% of "phones" properties → shifts toward technology
- The new representation is contextually appropriate

## Self-Attention Overview {#overview}

### What Self-Attention Does

1. **Takes a sentence:** "I love Apple phones"
2. **Identifies relationships** between each word and every other word
3. **Generates new representations** for each word based on these relationships
4. **Result:** Context-aware word embeddings

### The Self-Attention Process

```
Input: Static word embeddings
       ↓
Self-Attention Mechanism
       ↓
Output: Contextual word representations
```

### Analogy: Gravity
Think of self-attention like gravity:
- Words "pull" each other based on their relationship strength
- Closer relationships = stronger pull
- Words move in embedding space toward related words
- Final positions = better contextual representations

---

## Building Self-Attention from Scratch {#mathematics}

### Step 1: Basic Weighted Combination
Create new word representation as weighted sum of all words:

```
Apple_new = w1 × Love + w2 × Apple + w3 × Phones
```

Where w1, w2, w3 are weights representing relationships.

### Step 2: What Are These Weights?
The weights represent **relationships/similarities** between words:
- w1 = How much is Apple related to Love?
- w2 = How much is Apple related to Apple?  
- w3 = How much is Apple related to Phones?

### Step 3: Calculating Similarity
Use **dot product similarity** to measure relationships:

```
Similarity(Apple, Phones) = Apple_embedding · Phones_embedding
```

**Why dot product?**
- If vectors are close → high dot product → high similarity
- If vectors are far → low dot product → low similarity

### Step 4: Converting to Probabilities
Dot products can be any value (positive/negative/large). We need probabilities that sum to 1.

**Solution: Softmax function**
```
Raw similarities: [-2, 8, 8]
After softmax: [0.0, 0.5, 0.5]
```

### Step 5: Final Calculation
```
Apple_new = 0.0×Love + 0.5×Apple + 0.5×Phones
```

## Problems with Basic Approach {#problems}

### Problem 1: No Learnable Parameters
- Current approach uses only mathematical operations
- No parameters to train for specific tasks
- Cannot adapt to different domains

**Example Issue:**
"I love Apple watch" - model might not understand Apple watch as a product because there's no learned relationship between "Apple" and "watch".

### Problem 2: Symmetric Relationships
Using same vectors everywhere creates symmetric similarities:
```
Similarity(Apple, Phones) = Similarity(Phones, Apple)
```

This means both words influence each other equally, which may not be desired.

### The Root Cause
We're using the same word embedding vector in three different roles:
1. As query (what word are we updating?)
2. As key (what words are we comparing against?)  
3. As value (what information are we incorporating?)

---

## Complete Self-Attention Solution {#complete-solution}

### The Key Innovation: Three Different Transformations
Instead of using the same embedding everywhere, create three specialized versions:

```
Q (Query) = Embedding × WQ    (What word are we focusing on?)
K (Key) = Embedding × WK      (What words to compare against?)
V (Value) = Embedding × WV    (What information to use?)
```

Where WQ, WK, WV are **learnable parameter matrices**.

### The Complete Process

**Step 1: Generate Q, K, V vectors**
```
For each word embedding E:
Q = E × WQ  (size: 1×64)
K = E × WK  (size: 1×64)  
V = E × WV  (size: 1×64)
```

**Step 2: Calculate similarities**
```
Similarity(Apple, Phones) = Q_Apple · K_Phones
Similarity(Apple, Love) = Q_Apple · K_Love
Similarity(Apple, Apple) = Q_Apple · K_Apple
```

**Step 3: Apply softmax**
```
[sim1, sim2, sim3] → softmax → [prob1, prob2, prob3]
```

**Step 4: Weighted combination**
```
Apple_new = prob1×V_Love + prob2×V_Apple + prob3×V_Phones
```

### Benefits of This Approach

1. **Learnable Parameters:** WQ, WK, WV can be trained for specific tasks
2. **Asymmetric Relationships:** Similarity(A,B) ≠ Similarity(B,A)
3. **Task Adaptation:** Model learns relevant relationships through training

## Matrix Implementation {#matrix-implementation}

### Dimensions (from "Attention is All You Need" paper)
- Word embedding size: 512
- Q, K, V size: 64  
- Weight matrices: 512 × 64

### For a 3-word sentence: "Love Apple Phones"

**Step 1: Input Matrix**
```
Embeddings = [3 × 512]  (3 words, 512 dimensions each)
```

**Step 2: Generate Q, K, V matrices**
```
Q = Embeddings × WQ = [3 × 512] × [512 × 64] = [3 × 64]
K = Embeddings × WK = [3 × 512] × [512 × 64] = [3 × 64]
V = Embeddings × WV = [3 × 512] × [512 × 64] = [3 × 64]
```

**Step 3: Calculate attention scores**
```
Scores = Q × K^T = [3 × 64] × [64 × 3] = [3 × 3]

Scores matrix:
        Love  Apple Phones
Love   [s11   s12   s13 ]
Apple  [s21   s22   s23 ]  
Phones [s31   s32   s33 ]
```

**Step 4: Apply softmax**
```
Attention_weights = softmax(Scores) = [3 × 3]
(Each row sums to 1)
```

**Step 5: Final output**
```
Output = Attention_weights × V = [3 × 3] × [3 × 64] = [3 × 64]
```

### The Mathematical Formula
```
Attention(Q,K,V) = softmax(QK^T)V
```

*Note: The paper includes division by √dk for scaling, covered in advanced topics*

## Benefits of Self-Attention {#benefits}

### 1. Parallel Processing
Unlike RNNs which process sequentially:

**RNN:** word1 → word2 → word3 → ... → wordN (O(n) time)
**Self-Attention:** All words processed simultaneously (O(1) time)

**Advantages:**
- Extremely fast training with multiple GPUs
- Same time to process 1 word or 1000 words
- Better utilization of hardware

### 2. Long-Range Dependencies
**RNN Problem:** Struggles to connect words far apart in long sentences

**Self-Attention Solution:** Every word directly connects to every other word
- No information loss over distance
- Perfect for long documents
- Better context understanding

### 3. Interpretability
- Attention weights show which words influence each other
- Visualizable relationships
- Better understanding of model decisions

### 4. Flexibility
- Same mechanism works for different tasks
- Learnable parameters adapt to specific domains
- No architectural changes needed for different sequence lengths
